/**
 * "More on this" — the return half of the internal linking.
 *
 * The six service pages deliberately share no section grammar or stylesheet,
 * and this does not break that: it is one row of text, styled in `currentColor`
 * so it reads correctly against a dark close section and a light one without
 * either page having to know which it is.
 *
 * It exists because equity was only ever flowing one way. The journal argues
 * for the services, but nothing pointed back, so the posts were near-orphans
 * and the service pages got no topical reinforcement from the writing that
 * supports them. Two links is the whole intervention — a long list of "related
 * reading" is a link farm with better manners, and dilutes the two that matter.
 *
 * Anchor text is the post's real title, read from POSTS rather than retyped, so
 * a retitled post can never leave a stale anchor behind pointing at it.

 * carry `.dark` (which sets white text) while their background is painted by a
 * JS-driven layer on scroll, so before that fires the row was white-on-paper
 * and effectively invisible.
 *
 * No single grey can fix it either — passing 4.5:1 against both #FAFAF8 and
 * #0B0B0C is arithmetically impossible. So this borrows the value the page
 * footers in these very sections already use, and puts the links in brand red,
 * which carries on both. Legible in every state, dark background or not.
