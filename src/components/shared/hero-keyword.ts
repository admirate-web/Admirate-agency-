/**
 * The keyword line inside a service page's H1.
 *
 * Every service page had a title targeting "<service> in Hyderabad" and an H1
 * that shared not one word with it — "BUILT TO BE KNOWN", "SITES THAT EARN
 * THEIR KEEP". The slogans are the best writing on the site and are not worth
 * losing, but the H1 is a strong relevance signal and all six were spending it
 * on copy that names neither the service nor the city.
 *
 * So the slogan keeps the H1 and the keyword joins it underneath, inside the
 * same heading, at caption size.
 *
 * Visible, deliberately. A keyword hidden behind `display:none`, a zero-height
 * box or off-screen positioning is cloaking — it is the oldest trick Google
 * penalises for, and it would put a manual action on the six pages that matter
 * most. This reads as a subtitle to a human because that is exactly what it is.
